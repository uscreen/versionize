Initially we thought of versionize as the leading tool for versioning, but we realized there are also use cases where you want to use versionize as a companion tool. For example, you might want to use versionize to bump the version in the manifest.json file, but you want to use another tool to bump the version in the package.json file. To support this use case, we added the --sync-from-pkg and --sync-from-mft options. These options allow you to sync the version from one file to another before bumping the version.
